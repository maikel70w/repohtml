	Whether cookies, pasta or mayonnaise, many food products contain eggs. Often, these eggs stem from farms where hens live cooped up in small cages. Although the majority of consumers are opposed to battery farming and almost all retailers have removed fresh cage eggs from their shelves, we are unknowingly still eating eggs produced in cages. So while stopping the sale of fresh cage eggs in supermarkets signaled an important victory for animal welfare, this has been just the first step.
